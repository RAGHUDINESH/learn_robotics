<h2> Hello and welcome to my blog

It is very usual to be attracted by some flashy terms like AI, Robotics and Data sciences but beginners find it difficult to find any reliable source to learn these stuff from basics.
Especially robotics which is pretty much open ended and doesn't have something which you can call a starting point for learning, it takes some effort to get an overiew of robotics.
Being the head of Robotics club of Indian Institute of Technology, i have been compling resources for my mentees who are basically second year undergrads intrested in robotics. So, i thought I'll take some time to update my blog with these content hoping it will also be helpful to someone wanting to learn Robotics from basics.
